# convetion
## share the context together
the developer and all agents should maintain and refer the context of the total project.
we define the `project-context.json` to share the context ,its structure like that
``` json
{
  "project_metadata": {
    "status": "Architecture Design",
    "version": "1.0.2"
  },
  "core_problem": "Define exactly what we are solving here.",
  "tech_stack": {
    "frontend": "Next.js",
    "backend": "Python/FastAPI",
    "database": "PostgreSQL"
  },
  "decisions_log": [
    "Decision 1: Use Supabase for Auth because of speed.",
    "Decision 2: Skip mobile version for MVP."
  ],
  "current_blockers": [
    "Need to define the API schema for the user profile."
  ]
}
```
each agent finish a task ,should update the status in the file.and they also refer the file before they take action.

# log
all agents should log their conversation with the developer in file `conversation-log.md` for the optimization in the future.
