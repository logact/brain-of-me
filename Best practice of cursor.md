# Core Principle
1. firstly, we should correct the previous wrong thought:  the developer don't need any knowledge of tech(pure vibe), the AI code assistants will work well with more detailed tech context(e.g the function implementation logic)
2. the developer should provide enough context including the "where the problem?" ,"how the data  flow","what's the basic implementation logic of some function "
3. so the developer should have a  [[#minimal understanding of a project]].


# Process of creating a new project
set the the global context like [[cursor user rules]] or [[cursor project rules]]
1. define the requirement doc and technique doc(define the constraint of the tech)
2. get the [[minimal understanding of a project]]
3. use the template to prompt.
# Process of add a new feature
# Process of fix a issue


# Appendix
## minimal understanding of a project

1. understand the architecture
	1. what tech dose the project use?
	2. what's the basic concept of the project's tech?
	3. what's the core component  and how they interact?
	4. how the core feature implement?
	5. how the project build and run?
2. how to use the specific tool of the project?
	1. how to read the log of the project?
	2. for some optimization issue we may need provide memory usage log.
